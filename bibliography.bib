@article{Poon2015LightningNetwork,
abstract = {The bitcoin protocol[1] can encompass the global financial transaction volume in all electronic payment systems today, without a single custodial 3rd party holding funds or requiring participants to have any more than a computer on a home broadband connection. A decentralized system is proposed whereby transactions are sent over a network of micropayment channels (a.k.a. payment channels or transaction channels) whose transfer of value occurs off-blockchain. If Bitcoin transactions can be signed with a new sighash type which addresses malleability, these transfers may occur between untrusted parties along the transfer route by contracts which are enforceable via broadcast over the bitcoin blockchain in the event of uncooperative or hostile participants, through a series of decrementing timelocks.},

@inproceedings{Hope-Bailie2016Interledger,
abstract = {The web has enabled free and open information exchange for a vast number of users around the world. However, it has so far failed to do the same for payments. Instead of finding the cheapest route for each payment from a competitive network of providers, we rely on a small number of proprietary operators with global reach. The work happening at the Web Payments Working Group at W3C is attempting to remove some of the friction in performing payments on the Web by defining a standard payment API and messaging in browsers. This will make payments on the Web easier but not entirely frictionless or integrated. As active participants in the W3C's Web Payments Working Group we present a browser polyfill[7] of one of the prosed payment APIs and will walk the audience through the goals of the WG and vision of how payments will work on the Web in the future. Building on this, we will introduce the Interledger Protocol (ILP), a new neutral payments protocol being incubated in the Interledger Payments Community Group, also at the W3C. We will demonstrate how, in the future, the combination of the W3C's Web Payments APIs and the power of ILP payments will not only be frictionless but fully integrated into how we use the Web.

@article{Amiri2019CAPER,
abstract = {Despite recent intensive research, existing blockchain systems do not adequately address all the characteristics of distributed applications. In particular, distributed applications collaborate with each other following service level agreements (SLAs) to provide different services. While collaboration between applications, e.g., cross-application transactions , should be visible to all applications, the internal data of each application, e.g, internal transactions, might be confidential. In this paper, we introduce CAPER, a per-missioned blockchain system to support both internal and cross-application transactions of collaborating distributed applications. In CAPER, the blockchain ledger is formed as a directed acyclic graph where each application accesses and maintains only its own view of the ledger including its internal and all cross-application transactions. CAPER also introduces three consensus protocols to globally order cross-application transactions between applications with different internal consensus protocols. The experimental results reveal the efficiency of CAPER in terms of performance and scalability.},

It allows for inter-contract and inter-blockchain function calls that are both synchronous and atomic: if one part fails, the whole call graph of function calls is rolled back. It is not based on existing techniques such as Hash Time Locked Contracts, relay chains, block header transfer, or trusted intermediaries. BLS Threshold Signatures are used to prove to validators on one blockchain that information came from another blockchain and that a majority of the validators of that blockchain agree on the information. Coordination Contracts are used to manage the state of a Crosschain Transaction and as a repository of Blockchain Public Keys. Dynamic code analysis and signed nested transactions are used together with live argument checking to ensure execution only occurs if the execution results in valid state changes. Contract Locking and Lockability enable atomic updates.},

@article{Herlihy2019CCDeals,
abstract = {Modern distributed data management systems face a new challenge: how can autonomous, mutually-distrusting parties cooperate safely and effectively? Addressing this challenge brings up questions familiar from classical distributed systems: how to combine multiple steps into a single atomic action, how to recover from failures, and how to synchronize concurrent access to data. Nevertheless, each of these issues requires rethinking when participants are autonomous and potentially adversarial. We propose the notion of a *cross-chain deal*, a new way to structure complex distributed computations that manage assets in an adversarial setting. Deals are inspired by classical atomic transactions, but are necessarily different, in important ways, to accommodate the decentralized and untrusting nature of the exchange. We describe novel safety and liveness properties, along with two alternative protocols for implementing cross-chain deals in a system of independent blockchain ledgers. One protocol, based on synchronous communication, is fully decentralized, while the other, based on semi-synchronous communication, requires a globally shared ledger.},

@inproceedings{Liu2019Hyperservice,
abstract = {Blockchain interoperability, which allows state transitions across different blockchain networks, is critical functionality to facilitate major blockchain adoption. Existing interoperability protocols mostly focus on atomic token exchanges between blockchains. However, as blockchains have been upgraded from passive distributed ledgers into programmable state machines (thanks to smart contracts), the scope of blockchain interoperability goes beyond just token exchanges. In this paper, we present HyperService, the first platform that delivers interoperability and programmability across heterogeneous blockchains. HyperService is powered by two innovative designs: (i) a developer-facing programming framework that allows developers to build cross-chain applications in a unified programming model; and (ii) a secure blockchain-facing cryptography protocol that provably realizes those applications on blockchains. We implement a prototype of HyperService in approximately 35,000 lines of code to demonstrate its practicality. Our experiments show that (i) HyperService imposes reasonable latency, in order of seconds, on the end-to-end execution of cross-chain applications; (ii) the HyperService platform is scalable to continuously incorporate new large-scale production blockchains.},

@inproceedings{Tai2017SALT,
abstract = {{\textcopyright}2017 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda. All rights reserved. Traditional ACID transactions, typically supported by relational database management systems, emphasize database consistency. BASE provides a model that trades some consistency for availability, and is typically favored by cloud systems and NoSQL data stores. With the increasing popularity of blockchain technology, another alternative to both ACID and BASE is introduced: SALT. In this keynote paper, we present SALT as a model to explain blockchains and their use in application architecture. We take both, a transaction and a transaction processing systems perspective on the SALT model. From a transactions perspective, SALT is about Sequential, Agreed-on, Ledgered, and Tamper-resistant transaction processing. From a systems perspective, SALT is about decentralized transaction processing systems being Symmetric, Admin-free, Ledgered and Time-consensual. We discuss the importance of these dual perspectives, both, when comparing SALT with ACID and BASE, and when engineering blockchain-based applications. We expect the next-generation of decentralized transactional applications to leverage combinations of all three transaction models.},

@inproceedings{Qasse2019,
abstract = {Blockchain technology is growing massively where the number of blockchain platforms and decentralized applications are increasing rapidly in the last years. However, most of the existing blockchain networks are operating in a standalone environment isolated from each other, which increases scalability and connectivity issues in the current blockchain platforms as well as limiting the blockchain adoption in industry ecosystems. In the current phase, different blockchain networks don't have mutual trust where they cannot interact with each other and their capacity level has only reached a level similar to LAN. Due to the high barriers between the independent isolated blockchain platforms, researchers have started to focus on the concept of Blockchain interoperability. Blockchain interoperability is the ability of connecting multiple blockchain networks together, which significantly increases and solves scalability and connectivity issues in the blockchain platforms. Given the potential of blockchain interoperability and cross blockchain communication, many researchers are working on finding the optimal cross blockchain communication solution. As blockchain interoperability is emerging as an essential blockchain feature, the number of proposed blockchain interoperability solutions have been increasing within the last few years. In this paper, a survey of all the available cross blockchain communication solutions are discussed with a comparison of the proposed architectures.},

@article{Siris2019,
abstract = {While blockchains and more generally distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) are passing over their hype curve peak, their shortcomings are becoming more apparent. One relatively recent approach to address their performance, scalability, privacy, and other problems are to use multiple different DLTs instead of relying on just one. While there are no really established standards for combining several DLTs, a few repeating patterns can be observed. In this paper, we present a survey of interledger approaches, discussing and comparing their underlying mechanisms. A shared motivation for all of the discussed interledger solutions is to move away from the 'one chain rules them all' model to one that allows the interconnection of multiple ledgers, with different features and advantages, while also supporting innovation. The interledger approaches discussed in this survey include 1) atomic cross-chain transactions, 2) transactions across a network of payment channels, 3) the W3C Interledger Protocol (ILP), 4) bridging, 5) sidechains, and 6) ledger-of-ledgers. The approaches are compared according to whether they support the transfer or the exchange of value, their interconnection trust mechanism, complexity, scalability, and transaction cost.},

abstract = {Recently, we have witnessed a trend that many industries are forming consortiums and attempting to accelerate efficiency and reduce cost by using blockchain technology. Nevertheless, there is a clear missing capability of cross-industry and cross-blockchain interoperability. Currently, most blockchain business networks operate in isolation without external data transfer or multi-blockchain interactions. For blockchain technology to ultimately deliver on its promise, blockchain networks must be able to scale from networks addressing individual business processes to very large scale networks of interconnected decentralized autonomous organizations addressing much larger business problems at the level of entire industries and across industries. In this paper, we envision the inception of Internet of Blockchains (IoB), where homogeneous and heterogeneous decentralized networks communicate to facilitate cross-chain transactions of value, data and state transition. In addition, we also discuss interledger techniques that are essential for enabling industry-scale blockchain networks as well as achieving scalable interconnectivity between disparate, distributed ledgers.},

@article{Singh2020Sidechains,
abstract = {In the last decade, blockchain has emerged as one of the most influential innovations in software architecture and technology. Ideally, blockchains are designed to be architecturally and politically decentralized, similar to the Internet. In recent times, however, blockchain-based systems have faced stumbling blocks in the form of challenges related to scalability, privacy, security, etc. Several new methods have been proposed both by the research and professional communities to mitigate these challenges. One such recent advancement proposed is the use of sidechains. A sidechain is a secondary blockchain connected to the main blockchain with a two-way peg. Sidechains may have their own consensus protocols, which could be completely different from the mainchain's protocol. Theoretically, a sidechain can add new functionalities, improve privacy, and security of traditionally vanilla blockchains. To this date, however, little is known or discussed regarding factors related to design choices, feasibility, limitations and other issues in adopting the sidechain technology. Moreover, there is a lack of studies discussing how and where it can effectively be integrated into blockchains to remedy current issues in a clear context. Hence, this paper provides the first comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art sidechains and platforms, identifying current advancements and analyzing their impact from various viewpoints, highlighting their limitations and discussing possible remedies for the overall improvement of the blockchain domain.},

@article{Johnson2019Sidechains,
abstract = {There appears to be an insatiable desire for spawning new bespoke blockchains to harness the functionality provided by blockchain technologies, resulting in a constant stream of blockchain start-up companies entering the market with their own unique vision and mission. Some target a particular niche market such as supply chain and financial services, while others strive to differentiate themselves from the increasingly saturated market by offering new functionality. This dynamic and constantly changing blockchain ecosystem makes it very challenging to keep abreast of all the latest breakthroughs and research. It is evident that there is also a growing desire to collaborate with others developing blockchain solutions, which brings new impetus to blockchain interoperability research. We review the strategies that some key players in the blockchain ecosystem have implemented, or are proposing to develop, to satisfy this increasing demand for cross-chain communication and transactions between sidechains. Interoperability presents a complex and challenging stumbling block to the wider uptake of blockchain technology. We find that although there is a plethora of blockchains and interoperability implementations, or proposals, at a higher level of abstraction there is only a handful of approaches. However, the way they are implemented can differ quite substantially. We present a summary of the reviews we conducted in a table for ease of comparing and contrasting.},
